| Type | Primary Uses | What to Keep in Mind |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| Pie Chart | • Synthesize quantitative or qualitative data.<br>• Display relative proportions of several classes of data • Provide visual check and proportional relationship without a lot of explanation. | You can show large amounts of data in total and compare against each other in easily understandable charts. You may want to ensure that you do not have too many "small" categories as these can make the pie chart too busy and difficult to visualize. |
| Line Graph | • Present the relationship between two variables (independent and dependent) over time. • Demonstrate trends and predictions visually to support discussion. | You can map the relationship between variables of interest to you over time in the past and also use for forecasting purposes. Check that the scale on the axis makes sense and is consistent; otherwise, the line graph may be unclear. |
| Frequency Distribution Table | • Summarize large amounts of data into groupings. • Present frequency of occurrence of a characteristic within the dataset. • Identify population characteristics to be compared. | This format uses a very intuitive approach; however, values on the extreme (that may be "surprises" and of interest to you) may be hidden within the larger classifications. Very large data sets should typically be segmented into intervals classes to make the table easier to read and understand. |
